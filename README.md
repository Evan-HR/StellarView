# STELLARGAZE

Stellargaze is a web app which allowed users to quickly locate areas in which naked-eye star visibility is maximized.

## Setup

In the Root, run "npm run setup", and then "npm run dev". Ensure your .env files are in both the client and the root. Connection data can be given by emailing `dustinjurkaulionis@gmail.com`

## How does it work?

Details on how it works can be found at https://www.stellargaze.com/FAQ

## What's next?

- Push notifications so users don't have to continuously check the website - our server will run the queries for you and then notify if there are parks above a score of 75%.
- Refactoring the code to allow for better open-source collaboration.
- Android/iOS application.
- Better login/registration system with e-mail confirmation, ability to change passwords, delete account, etc.
- More accurate weather predictions using a paid weather API service.
